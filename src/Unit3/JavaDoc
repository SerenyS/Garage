For my UNIT 3 project I used Strategy Factory to create a simpler system to create
different ticket types and modify the properties of each. I created a two interfaces
one for Tickets and one for the TicketFactory. Ticket was implemented on the different
tickets possible and their properties. TicketFactory was implemented on "TicketType" class
to help determine what ticket was created. All the input and output was managed by the
Garage class.
